            <p>&ldquo;Intentional and controlled. Slow and steady. Make intentional movements. Don&rsquo;t do it the hard way,&rdquo; Scott says. </p>

            <p>The 15-year-old collapses forward, her head resting on the mat between her legs. She gathers herself and tries again. She&rsquo;s determined; focused to a point of stubbornness. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so weird. I don&rsquo;t have any abs. I&rsquo;m like a fish; a noodle fish,&rdquo; she says. </p>
            <p>A month ago, the Eagle teen with an eye-on-the-prize fixation was harvesting medals with soaring backflips and a distinctive style that made her one of freeskiing&rsquo;s hottest up-and-comers. </p>
            <p>But that was before. This is after. </p>
            <p> Before: A contender on skis, a lifelong athlete who excelled at everything she pursued. After: The same athlete, but with only one-third of her body able to hear her brain&rsquo;s commands. </p>
            <p>Two months ago she was on the fast track to becoming a pro skier. Her goal on this day at Craig Hospital in Englewood &mdash; almost a month after she was paralyzed from the chest down &mdash; is to put on her shoes.</p>
            <h5 class="section-headline">EVERYTHING WENT NUMB</h5>
            <p>Kailyn was on fire when she loaded up the chair at Copper Mountain a little before 7 a.m. on Tuesday, April 7. She had floated lofty right-side 540-degree spins above the lip of the Copper halfpipe a few days earlier, throwing her best-ever run to earn silver in the USA Snowboard and Freeski Association&rsquo;s national competition. The night before, her first-ever 270-degree spin onto the down tube earned a second silver in the rail contest.</p>

            <p>She was on a roll &mdash; the culmination of three years of practice, training and coaching &mdash; heading into her favorite competition: slopestyle. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;I was excited. I was stoked. I had my puffy coat on. I had my sweat shirt. I was ready to go,&rdquo; she says. </p>
            <p>A beeper connected to her mechanized wheelchair chimes in Room 411 at Craig. She interrupts her story to push a lever, which rotates her chair back, putting her in a prone position. That helps to prevent bed sores.</p>
            <p>It was cold that morning, Kailyn remembers. She was up at 6 a.m. First in line at the chairlift. </p>
            <p>The snow was hard. Fast. Her first run down the slopestyle course &mdash; a series of rails followed by two huge jumps &mdash; went well. The jumps, she recalls, were &ldquo;a little lippy,&rdquo; hurling skiers skyward. </p>
            <p>She waved to her mom and sister as she skied into her second practice run. She was smooth and flawless while skiing the rails at the top of the course on her second practice run. She was feeling it. On the first jump, she went for her signature move: the backflip. She had thrown it hundreds of times, if not thousands.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;As soon as I set it, I knew I went way too much. I was over-rotating and it was like so scary because I could see the landing and I just kept rotating,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was like, 'Oh, no, that&rsquo;s not good.' Seeing the landing go by on anything is real scary.&rdquo;</p>

                <p class="breakout-box-type">Slopestyle is dangerous. Skiers and snowboarders hurling themselves 100-plus feet in the air while spinning and flipping is inherently risky. And for women, it's one of the most perilous pursuits of any competitive sport.</p>
                <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;There's an alarming number of slopestyle injuries that have occurred in the last year or two,&rdquo; said Dr. Tom Hackett, an orthopedic surgeon at Vail&rsquo;s Steadman Clinic.</p>
                <p class="breakout-box-type">Hackett is a <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/olympics/ci_25048158/dr-tom-hackett-just-what-u-s-snowboardings" title="Dr. Tom Hackett just what U.S. Snowboarding's Olympic team ordered">longtime team doctor for the U.S. ski and snowboard teams</a> and works with the country&rsquo;s top snowsports athletes at every major competition. There was a surge in athlete injuries at the Sochi Olympics, which hosted the first-ever Olympic slopestyle contests at the intimidating Rosa Khutor Extreme Park.</p>

                <h5 class="breakout-box-headline">A SURGE IN TERRAIN-PARK INJURIES</h5>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">Of more than two dozen athletes who were injured in the park&rsquo;s halfpipe, slopestyle course and ski/snowboard cross course, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/olympics/ci_25095926/young-american-athletes-keep-getting-injured-sochi" title="Young American athletes keep getting injured in Sochi">about three-quarters were women</a>. The most serious accident of the Games involved Russia's <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/nationworld/ci_25151707/russian-skicross-racer-suffers-spinal-injury-course-undergoes" title="Russian skicross racer suffers spinal injury on course, undergoes surgery">Maria Komissarova, who fractured her spine</a> during a training run on the super-sized ski cross course, leaving her paralyzed. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">The surge in recent terrain park injuries world-wide sparked Hackett to launch a study of slopestyle injuries at major competitions. It&rsquo;s the first study of its kind. He has enlisted the world&rsquo;s top course designers, engineers and athlete representatives to present his information to the International Olympic Committee and the International Federation of Skiing in Switzerland next month. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;Sochi was troubling. We need to talk about the future of the slopestyle, basically what&rsquo;s going to happen in Korea,&rdquo; Hackett said of the 2018 Winter Olympics set for South Korea. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">While he hasn&rsquo;t sat down and analyzed all of his data yet, there&rsquo;s one obvious and troubling trend.</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;We have certainly seen some alarming rates of injury in women for sure,&rdquo; he said. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">One reason for the high rate of injuries among women is that they tend to be smaller than men and with less body mass they often struggle to reach the speed they need to clear jumps that can span more than 100 feet of flat terrain before the snow slopes into a landing. When it snows during competitions and skiers and snowboarders lose speed on their approach to the jumps, women have a smaller window to make a safe jump. The slightest bobble in their approach can slow them and lead to a crash.</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">But it&rsquo;s not just their size that leads to more crashes for women than men. The muscles in their legs fire differently, making them land differently than men, Hackett said. Women&rsquo;s neck muscles in proportion to their head mass are different than men, leading to more head injuries. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;Concussions are a real issue for women,&rdquo; Hackett said. </p>

                    <p class="breakout-box-type">The list of serious injuries and even death among women in the terrain park is long. Four days after Eagle freeskier Kailyn Forsberg suffered a spinal injury on the Copper Mountain slopestyle course during the U.S.A. Snowboard and Freeski Association nationals, Park City, Utah pro skier <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoCrazy">Jamie Crane-Mauzy </a>suffered a traumatic brain injury on the Whistler slopestyle course during the Association of Freeskiing Professionals World Championships. The 22-year-old was in a medically induced coma for almost a week. Today she is recovering and hopes to be skiing next year. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">Pioneering freeskier Sarah Burke never awoke from her medically induced coma. She died from a head injury she sustained in the Park City, Utah halfpipe while training for the Vancouver Olympics in January 2012. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">Burke is heralded as the fighter who earned women not just a spot in the X Games halfpipe and slopestyle contests, but equal purses, a rarity in women&rsquo;s professional sports. Burke was <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/olympics/ci_25194189/after-womens-olympic-ski-halfpipe-dream-late-sarah" title="With first women's Olympic ski halfpipe, a dream for late Sarah Burke is fulfilled"> instrumental in getting ski halfpipe accepted into the Olympics as well. </a>
                    </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">Some of the old school skiers and snowboarders who remember that fight often reject arguments that women should have their own specific slopestyle courses. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;We all fought so long and hard for equality,&rdquo; says <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/olympics/ci_25104664/keri-herman-breckenridge-ready-big-moment-at-sochi-games-slopestyle" title="Keri Herman of Breckenridge ready for big moment at Sochi in slopestyle">Breckenridge&rsquo;s Olympic slopestyle skier Keri Herman</a>. "I don&rsquo;t agree we should always have smaller jumps."</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">Herman wouldn&rsquo;t hit them anyway. Even though many slopestyle skiers and snowboarders &mdash; men and women &mdash; <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/olympics/ci_25058983/olympic-slopestyle-hopefuls-discuss-course-prior-sochi-games" title="Olympic slopestyle hopefuls discuss course prior to Sochi games">expressed angst at the size of the jumps in the Sochi Olympics</a>, very few opted to throw their tricks off the smaller jumps. Smaller jumps lead to smaller scores from judges, who weigh amplitude and progression when assigning points for runs. The same goes for the Winter X Games in Aspen: very few women opt to hit the smaller jumps. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">But those are the very best athletes in the sport, Herman said. </p>                        
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">Course designers at smaller events, such as the USASA nationals and the Rev Tour, which are stepping stones to the invitation-only events such as the Dew Tour and the X Games, should sculpt jumps based on the athletes, Herman said. She supports a graduated course design based on the size and ability of the athletes. Ten-year-old kids should not be competing on the same course as professionals, she said. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;Jumps should be adjusted for smaller contests. They know they are not attracting X Games-caliber athletes, so they should build the course accordingly, to fit exactly who is participating in the contest. Course designers should be held accountable,&rdquo; Herman said. &ldquo;I hate that people keep blaming women. This is a dangerous sport and injury is part of the game.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">Freeskiers and snowboarders are concerned that the FIS and IOC may install strict prohibitions on their sport, not unlike the FIS rule that prevents double flips in freestyle skiing. Hackett is aware of that worry. He&rsquo;s not lobbying for limits on tricks. Still, he said, there should be some science and accepted specifications in course design.</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">Course builders often grapple with slope angle and different types of manmade snow when sculpting slopestyle courses, both of which impact the speed and trajectory of athletes. There&rsquo;s no accepted standards for course design.</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;Jump design has some tremendous variability in it and no real specific consensus on what is safe and what isn't,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Part of what we are working on with the IOC is the science of park design and using some specifications.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">Hackett is hoping to sway the IOC and FIS to support changes so the problems of Sochi don&rsquo;t plague South Korea&rsquo;s events in 2018, he said. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;Some of that boils down to course design and the snowmaking that&rsquo;s going to be done and trying to identify the best people to create and construct the course rather than the best political person for the job,&rdquo; Hackett said. </p>

            <p>She had crashed many times before, but always gotten up.</p>
            <p>Not this time. This time her speed, her height on the jump, her rotation, and her position at impact were among factors conspiring against her. She landed on her neck and shoulders, slamming into the hard snow on her right side. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;As soon as I landed everything went numb and tingled,&rdquo; she says. </p>
            <p>She reached for her stomach. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;It felt like there was a big shell around me,&rdquo; she says.</p>
            <p>A jump marshall &mdash; a volunteer, likely a parent of a competitor &mdash; ran up. He asked if she was OK.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I said no, I broke my neck. He said are you sure? I said yes, I&rsquo;m pretty sure. I can&rsquo;t move my legs.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Her mom, Kimberly, ran down to the jump with her little sister, Kiara. Her father, Mitch, skied up next. He saw blood on the snow. Ski patrollers scrambled around her.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Just trying to make sense. What in the world is happening,&rdquo; Mitch says. &ldquo;I got as close to her as I could to let her know I was there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Kimberly had never seen her daughter compete in a slopestyle competition. Kailyn apologized for ruining her mom&rsquo;s first chance. She asked Kiara to snap a photo of her getting strapped in the ski patrol sled. Medics rushed her to a helicopter. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;That was a scary ride,&rdquo; she says. </p>
            <h5 class="section-headline">BURYING HER EMOTIONS</h5>
            <p>Kailyn was walking at 9 months. She was skiing at 13 months. She was barely 5 years old when she was spinning 180s off a snow-covered picnic table in a park near her home in Eagle. </p>
            <p>She always pushed herself. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Not a daredevil, but daring,&rdquo; Mitch says. </p>
            <p>She played soccer, lacrosse and baseball as the only girl in the league. Playing football with the boys through seventh grade, they would hit her hard, as if to scare her off the field.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;She always just got right back up, without even a whimper,&rdquo; Mitch says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s ever cried from injury.&rdquo;</p>
                <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 columns right">
                <blockquote>&ldquo;I told Kailyn I think I&lsquo;ve cried more than she has. You know what she told me? She said, &lsquo;Dad, you gotta man up.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;<br>
                <cite>&nbsp;Mitch Forsberg, Kailyn&rsquo;s father</cite></blockquote>
                </div>
            <p>In the days after her crash at Copper Mountain, surgeons at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado fused the bones around the C-7 vertebrae that exploded when she crashed, sending shards of bone into her spinal cord. They repaired her broken pelvis and reset her dislocated hip. Kailyn could barely sit up in bed. She couldn&rsquo;t move anything below her chest. Doctors warned her to prepare for life in a wheelchair. </p>
            <p>She visited with a psychologist.</p>
            <p>The therapist told Mitch and Kimberley that their daughter might not be processing what was happening.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;He said Kailyn was burying her emotions,&rdquo; Mitch says.</p>
            <p>But Dad told the therapist: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just stoic. That&rsquo;s her way. That&rsquo;s always been her way.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>She&rsquo;s not emotional. She doesn&rsquo;t have high highs or low lows. Even now that a catastrophic injury has changed her life. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;I told Kailyn the other night I think I've cried more than she has,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You know what she told me? She said, &lsquo;Dad, you gotta man up.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Hang with Kailyn for a while and you can see her toughness, her strength. Yes, she&rsquo;s joking about her injury. She can be surly. Grouchy. Feisty. She can seem to be avoiding the grieving process that doctors and therapists say is an essential step to rehabilitation.</p>
            <p>But when she locks her jaw, balls her fists and steels her gaze, Kailyn looks forward.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It happened. I don&rsquo;t think I've cried really. I just don&rsquo;t. If I keep thinking like that, I&rsquo;m not going to be able to do anything, so there&rsquo;s no point really,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You gotta think: &lsquo;Yeah, it happened, but you can&rsquo;t really go back. I&rsquo;m here. I gotta do it.&rsquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;</p>

        <h5 class="section-headline">REASONS FOR OPTIMISM</h5>
            <p>When Kailyn left Children&rsquo;s Hospital after 13 days, she had some feeling at the base of her spine. That bumped her from the Category A spinal injury &mdash; the most severe, with no motor or sensory activity below the injury &mdash; to B, which is incomplete, with some feeling, but no movement. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;We are hopeful that she will start getting some movement, but only time will tell,&rdquo; says Dr. Mark Johansen, the 16-year spinal doctor at Craig known by his patients as Dr. J. &ldquo;Her spinal cord has been severely injured. Some of those nerves are probably gone for good. Basically time will tell what she is able to recover.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Craig has room for 92 patients with its spacious suites, cafe, gym and therapy rooms. The hospital &mdash; renowned as one of the best rehabilitation centers in the country &mdash; is typically close to full. </p>
            <p>Patients usually stay about three months. Almost every hour, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., is booked with some form of therapy. Kailyn sees occupational and physical therapists every day, on top of school tutoring.</p>
            <p>There is a sense of urgency. The harried pace is intentional. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Most of the recovery a person will get after an injury of this type occurs in the first six months,&rdquo; says Johansen, the medical director of Craig&rsquo;s spinal cord injury program. &ldquo;We ask patients to do something very difficult, which is to live in the moment, to live in the day, and obviously hope for more improvement down the line.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The early prognosis for Kailyn is helped by her age and her background. Younger patients with spinal cord injuries tend to see their nerves heal better than older patients, Johansen says. And athletes &mdash; especially those with tremendous body awareness such as Kailyn, who spent years honing skills that allowed her to spin and flip high above snow &mdash; tend to improve more quickly.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Athletes are well ahead of the curve already,&rdquo; Johansen says, noting that while most spinal cord injury patients follow statistical patterns in terms of recovery, some &ldquo;outliers&rdquo; have surprised him. &ldquo;The truly remarkable patients on the far end of the spectrum are typically young like Kailyn.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>In Room 411 on Craig&rsquo;s newly expanded fourth floor, Kailyn is among the new arrivals at the rehabilitation facility.</p>
            <p>The camaraderie among the newbies is strong. Parents and spouses share that bond as well. The freshly injured &mdash; many skiers, a motorcycle rider, several car crash victims and a musically gifted teenage girl paralyzed from the neck down by a poliolike virus &mdash; seem to be in a bit of a haze as they adjust to the suddenness of how their life has changed forever.</p>
            <p>Kailyn, though, doesn&rsquo;t seem dazed. She has hung her medals on her mirror. Posters &mdash; signed by her friends &mdash; cover every wall. She has a fresh crop of tie-dye T-shirts, also signed by her army of friends. </p>
            <p>She hates the slow speed on her mechanized wheelchair, preferring to keep it locked in high gear. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Why do they even have that slow speed?&rdquo; she asks.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got one speed,&rdquo; Kimberly says. &ldquo;Always has. Fast.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>She is tackling occupational and physical therapy with the same competitive focus she brought to skiing, soccer and lacrosse.</p>
            <p>And she is cracking wise at nearly every step, nicknaming her caretakers. The nurse with laryngitis, the one wearing the mask, is &ldquo;Ebola.&rdquo;</p>
            <p> The joking is a tool. A way to deal with the stress. Kailyn admits as much. But that aloofness fades in therapy. She is serious about her work. </p>
            <p>When Kailyn arrived at Craig, she had limited mobility in her hands. Especially her right hand. She couldn&rsquo;t touch her fingers to her thumb. Several times a week she rolls down to Craig&rsquo;s basement to work that hand. </p>

            <p>Occupational therapist Nicole Cantos straps Kailyn&rsquo;s right hand into an Austrian machine called the Tyromotion Amadeo. With magnets taped to her finger tips, the machine prods her to extend and flex each finger using video-game graphics. After initially marveling at how quickly the magnets snap onto her braces, Kailyn targets video-game victory. Her fingers maneuver a bucket to catch apples falling from trees. She misses one apple. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Can we start over?&rdquo; she says.</p>
            <p>Outside the therapy room, the Forsberg family has been relegated to the hall. They are too distracting. A Helen Keller quote adorns a wall beneath photos of sit-skiers and sled hockey players: &ldquo;One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>When Kailyn isn&rsquo;t looking, the sadness looms larger. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Our emotions are like this,&rdquo; says grandfather George Forsberg, rolling his hand along unseen waves. </p>
            <h5 class="section-headline">COMING TO GRIPS WITH INJURY</h5>
            <p>Days and nights, one blending into the other, become exhausting for the Forsbergs.</p>
            <p>Craig nurses come into the suitelike room every two hours all night to adjust Kailyn. That usually wakes Mitch or Kimberly, who alternate nights on a pullout couch while the other sleeps at a nearby apartment with Kiara, who transferred to an elementary school in Aurora. Kimberly hasn&rsquo;t slept much, and when she escapes to the apartment for sleep, she feels guilty for being away from her girl. Mitch pretty much always looks tired.</p>

                <blockquote>&ldquo;I think of my baby and &lsquo;what if.&rsquo; What if she never walks again? It can be so overwhelming.&rdquo;<br>
                <cite>&nbsp;Kimberly Forsberg, Kailyn&lsquo;s mother</cite></blockquote>
                </div>
            <p>In the fourth-floor gym, Kimberly wedges herself into a corner so she can focus on Kailyn. She doesn&rsquo;t like to see the other patients; the ones who are triumphantly climbing out of their chairs and the ones who can&rsquo;t move their arms. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;This room scares me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I look around and I think of my baby and &lsquo;what if.&rsquo; What if she never walks again? It can be so overwhelming.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Mitch, on leave from his job as a principal, doesn&rsquo;t let himself get too low, at least not in front of Kailyn.</p>                
            <p>While he admits he can&rsquo;t shake &ldquo;my nightmare for her&mdash; his daughter in the air, seeing her feet pass over her as she plummets &mdash; he somehow stays upbeat. He jokes and lovingly teases his daughter, just as he always has. He rarely takes his eyes off Kailyn, focusing all of his energy on her. It&rsquo;s as if he&rsquo;s showing her nothing has changed. Dad&rsquo;s right there, just like before, just like he always will be. </p>
            <p>He&rsquo;s seeing Kailyn coming to grips with her injury in her own way. He&rsquo;s not pushing her. He never has. Kailyn has always pushed herself.</p>

                    <p class="cutline">Kailyn practices wheelies with the assistance of her father, Mitch, on May 12, 2015. Mitch, who started Forsberg on skis when she was just 1, says that Kailyn is the toughest person he knows. <em>AAron Ontiveroz, The Denver Post</em></p>
                </div>
            <p>&ldquo;As adults, we end up projecting,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We are mourning all that we've had from then to now. But we forget Kailyn hasn&rsquo;t had that yet.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>There was a time, early on, when Kailyn was at Children&rsquo;s, that Mitch was mad at the sport that had knocked down his girl. He still might be. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated,&rdquo; he says. </p>
            <p>Kailyn isn&rsquo;t harboring any angst against her sport. She still embraces skiing. At Craig, she is glued to her phone, sharing ski videos with anyone who will watch. She is a skier. She identifies herself wholly as a member of the tribe.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Seeing Kailyn happy on the hill made me happy. I don&rsquo;t regret introducing her to skiing,&rdquo; Mitch says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regret sharing skiing, or biking, or hunting, or fishing or camping ... with Kailyn and Kiara. They will have memories for a lifetime and will make a lifetime of memories more. You support your kids and the things that bring them joy.&rdquo;</p>
            <h5 class="section-headline">A DRIVE TO LEARN</h5>
            <p>The Forsbergs aren&rsquo;t about to relinquish hope that Kailyn will walk. She has surprised them all of her life. She continues to awe them. </p>
            <p> Mitch waited until Kailyn had been at Craig more than a month before finally returning to Eagle to talk with a contractor friend about renovating the family&rsquo;s split-level home to accommodate a wheelchair. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;It feels like such a significant next step,&rdquo; he says. </p>
            <p>They celebrate any evidence that buoys a glimmer of hope. Those glimmers arrived early in Kailyn&rsquo;s stay at Craig. </p>
            <p>Kailyn was lying on her belly for one of her first physical therapy sessions. She had been practicing her rolls. It&rsquo;s her favorite move, rolling onto her belly from her back. She throws her arms to her side and pins her chin on her shoulder. It reminds her, she says, of the set-up for a 360 or 540 on skis. </p>
            <p>Adele Stalder, the veteran physical therapist who is directing her rehab, later massages her legs, flexing her feet, ankles and knees. Kailyn&rsquo;s face is buried in a pillow. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you take my shoes off,&rdquo; Kailyn says. </p>
            <p>Everyone around the mat &mdash; the Forsberg posse &mdash; jumps to attention. </p>
            <p>Stalder asks: &ldquo;What am I doing?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Kailyn: &ldquo;You are touching my toes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Stray messages are navigating through her battered spinal cord. Everyone is ecstatic.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Did you hear that? She feels something,&rdquo; says grandma Betty Forsberg, who with George has spent every day of the past six weeks with Kailyn. &ldquo;That gives me hope. That right there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>George and Betty like to say this phrase often. It&rsquo;s become a sort of mantra for the Forsbergs: &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t do that <i>yet</i>.&rdquo;</p>

                <h5 class="breakout-box-headline">HIGH FIVES FUNDS REHABILITATION, FUELS STOKE FOR LIFE AFTER INJURY</h5>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">The seven men and women at Craig Hospital who are working with California's High Fives Foundation are athletes, not  patients.</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;They were athletes before they were injured and they remain athletes,&rdquo; says Roy Tuscany, the 33-year-old co-founder and executive director of High Fives, which has helped 79 injured athletes &mdash; mostly skiers and snowboarders &mdash; in the past six years with more than $1 million in funding for rehabilitation.</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">The foundation is considering a funding request from Kailyn Forsberg, the 15-year-old freeskier who was injured in early April during a national slopestyle competition at Copper Mountain.</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">Tuscany, and High Fives&rsquo; first-ever athlete Steve Wallace, met Forsberg last week at Craig Hospital and they shared their message: it gets better.</p>

                    <h5 class="breakout-box-headline">TEACHING SMART DECISION-MAKING IN THE MOUNTAINS</h5>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">The two men would know. Tuscany spent a year in a wheelchair after he overshot a jump in the Mammoth Mountain terrain park in 2006, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Wallace suffered a spinal injury in a fall at Squaw Valley in 2008. Through intense rehabilitation, the two are out of their wheelchairs and driven to help athletes who have suffered devastating injuries. Their foundation this year expanded beyond helping just skiers and snowboarders, growing their reach into all mountain sports. The foundation's grant-based athlete recovery fund supports mountain athletes with rehabilitation after insurance runs out. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">The foundation&rsquo;s education program &mdash; designed to promote safety and smart decision-making in the mountains &mdash; has reached more than 100,000 young athletes in the last few years through school presentations, videos and safety awareness campaigns such as &ldquo;Helmets Are Cool.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;It&lsquo;s pretty amazing to be able to give back,&rdquo; Wallace says.</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">The pair spent a few days recently spinning through the rooms of friends at Craig. It was a light-hearted tour, with lots of laughing and hanging out. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really show a weak side,&rdquo; Tuscany says. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">His positive outlook is infectious in a place where the injured are grappling with new life trajectories. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident and comfortable with my awareness that being paralyzed was the best thing that ever happened to me,&rdquo; Tuscany says. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">That&rsquo;s a hard message to sell to someone like Forsberg who is in the first stages of coming to grips with her new life.  It&rsquo;s not likely Forsberg is ready to embrace the idea that good can come from her paralysis. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s on her way there. The athletes that succeed are the ones who are comfortable with that realization,&rdquo; Tuscany says. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">Forsberg is telling the High Fives guys about her favorite concerts at Vail Village near her home. She&rsquo;s a big fan of crowd surfing. Even though the sea of hands failed her at a Girl Talk concert and she crashed onto the bricks. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;What if my injury was from crowd surfing and someone dropped me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That would be so embarrassing.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;But you'd have such a good story,&rdquo; Wallace says. </p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">It&rsquo;s a good sign that Forsberg is laughing  about her injury, Tuscany says later. It&rsquo;s a step toward embracing her new reality.</p>
                    <p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see her joking. I&rsquo;m just blown away by how good she is doing here,&rdquo; Tuscany says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reason Craig is the best. They do amazing work here.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>They have good reason to emphasize the <i>yet</i>. Kailyn has improved by leaps since she arrived. She received a manual wheelchair exactly one month after her accident. Within an hour, she was mastering the wheelie. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Thirty seconds,&rdquo; she says with not a little pride, noting how long she could balance on two wheels. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s harder than a rail slide, that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>She&rsquo;s determined to regain control of her body.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a great drive to learn things,&rdquo; Stalder says. &ldquo;She is focused. She is going to be one of the people on the high end of her level of injury in terms of what she can accomplish.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>For now, Kailyn is thinking about seeing her friends after she checks out of Craig on July 9. Enjoying a bit of the summer when she returns to her home in Eagle sometime in July. She is ready to go fishing.</p>
            <p>She plans to share a message when she gets home: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take anything for granted.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You realize how much you take for granted,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Walking, that&rsquo;s pretty helpful. Legs, they are pretty nice to have. When you don&rsquo;t have them, you are like 'Oh, that&rsquo;s a lot different.' So don&rsquo;t take anything for granted. Appreciate it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Despite the painful bite it&rsquo;s inflicted on her, Kailyn isn&rsquo;t giving up on skiing. The rewards of a day on the hill still resonate with her. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;I plan to ski again. Mono-skiing seems so hard. I don&rsquo;t know about backflips though,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That would be terrifying. So scary. I&rsquo;m not going to do that. Well, maybe not.&rdquo;</p>
