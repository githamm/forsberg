			<p>The 15-year-old collapses forward, her head resting on the mat between her legs. She gathers herself and tries again. She&rsquo;s determined; focused to a point of stubbornness.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so weird. I don&rsquo;t have any abs. I&rsquo;m like a fish; a noodle fish,&rdquo; she says.</p>
			<p>A month ago, the Eagle teen with an eye-on-the-prize fixation was harvesting medals with soaring backflips and a distinctive style that made her one of freeskiing&rsquo;s hottest up-and-comers.</p>
			<p>But that was before. This is after.</p>
			<p>Before: A contender on skis, a lifelong athlete who excelled at everything she pursued. After: The same athlete, but with only one-third of her body able to hear her brain&rsquo;s commands.</p>
			<p>Two months ago she was on the fast track to becoming a pro skier. Her goal on this day at Craig Hospital in Englewood &mdash; almost a month after she was paralyzed from the chest down &mdash; is to put on her shoes.</p>
			<h5 class="section-headline">&ldquo;EVERYTHING WENT NUMB&rdquo;</h5>
			<p>Kailyn was on fire when she loaded up the chair at Copper Mountain a little before 7 a.m. on Tuesday, April 7. She had floated lofty right-side 540-degree spins above the lip of the Copper halfpipe a few days earlier, throwing her best-ever run to earn silver in the USA Snowboard and Freeski Association&rsquo;s national competition. The night before, her first-ever 270-degree spin onto the down tube earned a second silver in the rail contest.</p>

			<p>She was on a roll &mdash; the culmination of three years of practice, training and coaching &mdash; heading into her favorite competition: slopestyle.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I was excited. I was stoked. I had my puffy coat on. I had my sweat shirt. I was ready to go,&rdquo; she says.</p>
			<p>A beeper connected to her mechanized wheelchair chimes in Room 411 at Craig. She interrupts her story to push a lever, which rotates her chair back, putting her in a prone position. That helps to prevent bed sores.</p>
			<p>It was cold that morning, Kailyn remembers. She was up at 6 a.m. First in line at the chairlift.</p>
			<p>The snow was hard. Fast. Her first run down the slopestyle course &mdash; a series of rails followed by two huge jumps &mdash; went well. The jumps, she recalls, were &ldquo;a little lippy,&rdquo; hurling skiers skyward.</p>
			<p>She waved to her mom and sister as she skied into her second practice run. She was smooth and flawless while skiing the rails at the top of the course on her second practice run. She was feeling it. On the first jump, she went for her signature move: the backflip. She had thrown it hundreds of times, if not thousands.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;As soon as I set it, I knew I went way too much. I was over-rotating and it was like so scary because I could see the landing and I just kept rotating,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was like, 'Oh, no, that&rsquo;s not good.' Seeing the landing go by on anything is real scary.&rdquo;</p>

					<p class="breakout-box-type">Hackett is a <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/olympics/ci_25048158/dr-tom-hackett-just-what-u-s-snowboardings" title="Dr. Tom Hackett just what U.S. Snowboarding's Olympic team ordered">longtime team doctor for the U.S. ski and snowboard teams</a> and works with the country&rsquo;s top snowsports athletes at every major competition. There was a surge in athlete injuries at the Sochi Olympics, which hosted the first-ever Olympic slopestyle contests at the intimidating Rosa Khutor Extreme Park.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">Of more than two dozen athletes who were injured in the park&rsquo;s halfpipe, slopestyle course and ski/snowboard cross course, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/olympics/ci_25095926/young-american-athletes-keep-getting-injured-sochi" title="Young American athletes keep getting injured in Sochi">about three-quarters were women</a>. The most serious accident of the Games involved Russia's <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/nationworld/ci_25151707/russian-skicross-racer-suffers-spinal-injury-course-undergoes" title="Russian skicross racer suffers spinal injury on course, undergoes surgery">Maria Komissarova, who fractured her spine</a> during a training run on the super-sized ski cross course, leaving her paralyzed.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">The surge in recent terrain park injuries world-wide sparked Hackett to launch a study of slopestyle injuries at major competitions. It&rsquo;s the first study of its kind. He has enlisted the world&rsquo;s top course designers, engineers and athlete representatives to present his information to the International Olympic Committee and the International Federation of Skiing in Switzerland next month.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;Sochi was troubling. We need to talk about the future of the slopestyle, basically what&rsquo;s going to happen in Korea,&rdquo; Hackett said of the 2018 Winter Olympics set for South Korea.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">While he hasn&rsquo;t sat down and analyzed all of his data yet, there&rsquo;s one obvious and troubling trend.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;We have certainly seen some alarming rates of injury in women for sure,&rdquo; he said.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">One reason for the high rate of injuries among women is that they tend to be smaller than men and with less body mass they often struggle to reach the speed they need to clear jumps that can span more than 100 feet of flat terrain before the snow slopes into a landing. When it snows during competitions and skiers and snowboarders lose speed on their approach to the jumps, women have a smaller window to make a safe jump. The slightest bobble in their approach can slow them and lead to a crash.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">But it&rsquo;s not just their size that leads to more crashes for women than men. The muscles in their legs fire differently, making them land differently than men, Hackett said. Women&rsquo;s neck muscles in proportion to their head mass are different than men, leading to more head injuries.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;Concussions are a real issue for women,&rdquo; Hackett said.</p>

					<p class="breakout-box-type">The list of serious injuries and even death among women in the terrain park is long. Four days after Eagle freeskier Kailyn Forsberg suffered a spinal injury on the Copper Mountain slopestyle course during the U.S.A. Snowboard and Freeski Association nationals, Park City, Utah pro skier <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoCrazy">Jamie Crane-Mauzy </a>suffered a traumatic brain injury on the Whistler slopestyle course during the Association of Freeskiing Professionals World Championships. The 22-year-old was in a medically induced coma for almost a week. Today she is recovering and hopes to be skiing next year.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">Pioneering freeskier Sarah Burke never awoke from her medically induced coma. She died from a head injury she sustained in the Park City, Utah halfpipe while training for the Vancouver Olympics in January 2012.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">Burke is heralded as the fighter who earned women not just a spot in the X Games halfpipe and slopestyle contests, but equal purses, a rarity in women&rsquo;s professional sports. Burke was <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/olympics/ci_25194189/after-womens-olympic-ski-halfpipe-dream-late-sarah" title="With first women's Olympic ski halfpipe, a dream for late Sarah Burke is fulfilled"> instrumental in getting ski halfpipe accepted into the Olympics as well. </a>
					</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">Some of the old school skiers and snowboarders who remember that fight often reject arguments that women should have their own specific slopestyle courses.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;We all fought so long and hard for equality,&rdquo; says <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/olympics/ci_25104664/keri-herman-breckenridge-ready-big-moment-at-sochi-games-slopestyle" title="Keri Herman of Breckenridge ready for big moment at Sochi in slopestyle">Breckenridge&rsquo;s Olympic slopestyle skier Keri Herman</a>. "I don&rsquo;t agree we should always have smaller jumps."</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">Herman wouldn&rsquo;t hit them anyway. Even though many slopestyle skiers and snowboarders &mdash; men and women &mdash; <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/olympics/ci_25058983/olympic-slopestyle-hopefuls-discuss-course-prior-sochi-games" title="Olympic slopestyle hopefuls discuss course prior to Sochi games">expressed angst at the size of the jumps in the Sochi Olympics</a>, very few opted to throw their tricks off the smaller jumps. Smaller jumps lead to smaller scores from judges, who weigh amplitude and progression when assigning points for runs. The same goes for the Winter X Games in Aspen: very few women opt to hit the smaller jumps.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">But those are the very best athletes in the sport, Herman said.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">Course designers at smaller events, such as the USASA nationals and the Rev Tour, which are stepping stones to the invitation-only events such as the Dew Tour and the X Games, should sculpt jumps based on the athletes, Herman said. She supports a graduated course design based on the size and ability of the athletes. Ten-year-old kids should not be competing on the same course as professionals, she said.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;Jumps should be adjusted for smaller contests. They know they are not attracting X Games-caliber athletes, so they should build the course accordingly, to fit exactly who is participating in the contest. Course designers should be held accountable,&rdquo; Herman said. &ldquo;I hate that people keep blaming women. This is a dangerous sport and injury is part of the game.&rdquo;</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">Freeskiers and snowboarders are concerned that the FIS and IOC may install strict prohibitions on their sport, not unlike the FIS rule that prevents double flips in freestyle skiing. Hackett is aware of that worry. He&rsquo;s not lobbying for limits on tricks. Still, he said, there should be some science and accepted specifications in course design.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">Course builders often grapple with slope angle and different types of manmade snow when sculpting slopestyle courses, both of which impact the speed and trajectory of athletes. There&rsquo;s no accepted standards for course design.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;Jump design has some tremendous variability in it and no real specific consensus on what is safe and what isn't,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Part of what we are working on with the IOC is the science of park design and using some specifications.&rdquo;</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">Hackett is hoping to sway the IOC and FIS to support changes so the problems of Sochi don&rsquo;t plague South Korea&rsquo;s events in 2018, he said.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;Some of that boils down to course design and the snowmaking that&rsquo;s going to be done and trying to identify the best people to create and construct the course rather than the best political person for the job,&rdquo; Hackett said.</p>

			<p>She had crashed many times before, but always gotten up.</p>
			<p>Not this time. This time her speed, her height on the jump, her rotation, and her position at impact were among factors conspiring against her. She landed on her neck and shoulders, slamming into the hard snow on her right side.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;As soon as I landed everything went numb and tingled,&rdquo; she says.</p>
			<p>She reached for her stomach.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It felt like there was a big shell around me,&rdquo; she says.</p>
			<p>A jump marshall &mdash; a volunteer, likely a parent of a competitor &mdash; ran up. He asked if she was OK.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I said no, I broke my neck. He said are you sure? I said yes, I&rsquo;m pretty sure. I can&rsquo;t move my legs.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Her mom, Kimberly, ran down to the jump with her little sister, Kiara. Her father, Mitch, skied up next. He saw blood on the snow. Ski patrollers scrambled around her.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Just trying to make sense. What in the world is happening,&rdquo; Mitch says. &ldquo;I got as close to her as I could to let her know I was there.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Kimberly had never seen her daughter compete in a slopestyle competition. Kailyn apologized for ruining her mom&rsquo;s first chance. She asked Kiara to snap a photo of her getting strapped in the ski patrol sled. Medics rushed her to a helicopter.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That was a scary ride,&rdquo; she says.</p>
			<h5 class="section-headline">&ldquo;BURYING HER EMOTIONS&rdquo;</h5>
			<p>Kailyn was walking at 9 months. She was skiing at 13 months. She was barely 5 years old when she was spinning 180s off a snow-covered picnic table in a park near her home in Eagle.</p>
			<p>She always pushed herself.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Not a daredevil, but daring,&rdquo; Mitch says.</p>
			<p>She played soccer, lacrosse and baseball as the only girl in the league. Playing football with the boys through seventh grade, they would hit her hard, as if to scare her off the field.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;She always just got right back up, without even a whimper,&rdquo; Mitch says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s ever cried from injury.&rdquo;</p>

			<!-- BLOCKQUOTE -->

			</div>

			<p>In the days after her crash at Copper Mountain, surgeons at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado fused the bones around the C-7 vertebrae that exploded when she crashed, sending shards of bone into her spinal cord. They repaired her broken pelvis and reset her dislocated hip. Kailyn could barely sit up in bed. She couldn&rsquo;t move anything below her chest. Doctors warned her to prepare for life in a wheelchair.</p>
			<p>She visited with a psychologist.</p>
			<p>The therapist told Mitch and Kimberly that their daughter might not be processing what was happening.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;He said Kailyn was burying her emotions,&rdquo; Mitch says.</p>
			<p>But Dad told the therapist: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just stoic. That&rsquo;s her way. That&rsquo;s always been her way.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>She&rsquo;s not emotional. She doesn&rsquo;t have high highs or low lows. Even now that a catastrophic injury has changed her life.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I told Kailyn the other night I think I've cried more than she has,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You know what she told me? She said, &lsquo;Dad, you gotta man up.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Hang with Kailyn for a while and you can see her toughness, her strength. Yes, she&rsquo;s joking about her injury. She can be surly. Grouchy. Feisty. She can seem to be avoiding the grieving process that doctors and therapists say is an essential
				step to rehabilitation.</p>
			<p>But when she locks her jaw, balls her fists and steels her gaze, Kailyn looks forward.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It happened. I don&rsquo;t think I've cried really. I just don&rsquo;t. If I keep thinking like that, I&rsquo;m not going to be able to do anything, so there&rsquo;s no point really,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You gotta think: &lsquo;Yeah, it happened, but you can&rsquo;t really go back. I&rsquo;m here. I gotta do it.&rsquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;</p>

			<h5 class="section-headline">REASONS FOR OPTIMISM</h5>
			<p>When Kailyn left Children&rsquo;s Hospital after 13 days, she had some feeling at the base of her spine. That bumped her from the Category A spinal injury &mdash; the most severe, with no motor or sensory activity below the injury &mdash; to B, which is incomplete, with some feeling, but no movement.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are hopeful that she will start getting some movement, but only time will tell,&rdquo; says Dr. Mark Johansen, the 16-year spinal doctor at Craig known by his patients as Dr. J. &ldquo;Her spinal cord has been severely injured. Some of those nerves are probably gone for good. Basically time will tell what she is able to recover.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Craig has room for 92 patients with its spacious suites, cafe, gym and therapy rooms. The hospital &mdash; renowned as one of the best rehabilitation centers in the country &mdash; is typically close to full.</p>
			<p>Patients usually stay about three months. Almost every hour, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., is booked with some form of therapy. Kailyn sees occupational and physical therapists every day, on top of school tutoring.</p>
			<p>There is a sense of urgency. The harried pace is intentional.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Most of the recovery a person will get after an injury of this type occurs in the first six months,&rdquo; says Johansen, the medical director of Craig&rsquo;s spinal cord injury program. &ldquo;We ask patients to do something very difficult, which is to live in the moment, to live in the day, and obviously hope for more improvement down the line.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The early prognosis for Kailyn is helped by her age and her background. Younger patients with spinal cord injuries tend to see their nerves heal better than older patients, Johansen says. And athletes &mdash; especially those with tremendous body awareness such as Kailyn, who spent years honing skills that allowed her to spin and flip high above snow &mdash; tend to improve more quickly.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Athletes are well ahead of the curve already,&rdquo; Johansen says, noting that while most spinal cord injury patients follow statistical patterns in terms of recovery, some &ldquo;outliers&rdquo; have surprised him. &ldquo;The truly remarkable patients on the far end of the spectrum are typically young like Kailyn.&rdquo;</p>

			<h5 class="section-headline">A COMPETITIVE FOCUS</h5>
			<p>In Room 411 on Craig&rsquo;s newly expanded fourth floor, Kailyn is among the new arrivals at the rehabilitation facility.</p>
			<p>The camaraderie among the newbies is strong. Parents and spouses share that bond as well. The freshly injured &mdash; many skiers, a motorcycle rider, several car crash victims and a musically gifted teenage girl paralyzed from the neck down by a poliolike virus &mdash; seem to be in a bit of a haze as they adjust to the suddenness of how their life has changed forever.</p>
			<p>Kailyn, though, doesn&rsquo;t seem dazed. She has hung her medals on her mirror. Posters &mdash; signed by her friends &mdash; cover every wall. She has a fresh crop of tie-dye T-shirts, also signed by her army of friends.</p>
			<p>She hates the slow speed on her mechanized wheelchair, preferring to keep it locked in high gear.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Why do they even have that slow speed?&rdquo; she asks.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got one speed,&rdquo; Kimberly says. &ldquo;Always has. Fast.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>She is tackling occupational and physical therapy with the same competitive focus she brought to skiing, soccer and lacrosse.</p>
			<p>And she is cracking wise at nearly every step, nicknaming her caretakers. The nurse with laryngitis, the one wearing the mask, is &ldquo;Ebola.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The joking is a tool. A way to deal with the stress. Kailyn admits as much. But that aloofness fades in therapy. She is serious about her work.</p>
			<p>When Kailyn arrived at Craig, she had limited mobility in her hands. Especially her right hand. She couldn&rsquo;t touch her fingers to her thumb. Several times a week she rolls down to Craig&rsquo;s basement to work that hand.</p>
			<p>Occupational therapist Nicole Cantos straps Kailyn&rsquo;s right hand into an Austrian machine called the Tyromotion Amadeo. With magnets taped to her finger tips, the machine prods her to extend and flex each finger using video-game graphics. After initially marveling at how quickly the magnets snap onto her braces, Kailyn targets video-game victory. Her fingers maneuver a bucket to catch apples falling from trees. She misses one apple.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Can we start over?&rdquo; she says.</p>
			<p>Outside the therapy room, the Forsberg family has been relegated to the hall. They are too distracting. A Helen Keller quote adorns a wall beneath photos of sit-skiers and sled hockey players: &ldquo;One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>When Kailyn isn&rsquo;t looking, the sadness looms larger.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our emotions are like this,&rdquo; says grandfather George Forsberg, rolling his hand along unseen waves.</p>
			<h5 class="section-headline">COMING TO GRIPS WITH INJURY</h5>
			<p>Days and nights, one blending into the other, become exhausting for the Forsbergs.</p>
			<p>Craig nurses come into the suitelike room every two hours all night to adjust Kailyn. That usually wakes Mitch or Kimberly, who alternate nights on a pullout couch while the other sleeps at a nearby apartment with Kiara, who transferred to an elementaryschool in Aurora. Kimberly hasn&rsquo;t slept much, and when she escapes to the apartment for sleep, she feels guilty for being away from her girl. Mitch pretty much always looks tired.</p>

			</div>

			<p>In the fourth-floor gym, Kimberly wedges herself into a corner so she can focus on Kailyn. She doesn&rsquo;t like to see the other patients; the ones who are triumphantly climbing out of their chairs and the ones who can&rsquo;t move their arms.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This room scares me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I look around and I think of my baby and &lsquo;what if.&rsquo; What if she never walks again? It can be so overwhelming.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Mitch, on leave from his job as a principal, doesn&rsquo;t let himself get too low, at least not in front of Kailyn.</p>
			<p>While he admits he can&rsquo;t shake &ldquo;my nightmare for her&mdash; his daughter in the air, seeing her feet pass over her as she plummets &mdash; he somehow stays upbeat. He jokes and lovingly teases his daughter, just as he always has. He rarely takes his eyes off Kailyn, focusing all of his energy on her. It&rsquo;s as if he&rsquo;s showing her nothing has changed. Dad&rsquo;s right there, just like before, just like he always will be.</p>
			<p>He&rsquo;s seeing Kailyn coming to grips with her injury in her own way. He&rsquo;s not pushing her. He never has. Kailyn has always pushed herself.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;As adults, we end up projecting,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We are mourning all that we've had from then to now. But we forget Kailyn hasn&rsquo;t had that yet.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>There was a time, early on, when Kailyn was at Children&rsquo;s, that Mitch was mad at the sport that had knocked down his girl. He still might be. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated,&rdquo; he says.</p>
			<p>Kailyn isn&rsquo;t harboring any angst against her sport. She still embraces skiing. At Craig, she is glued to her phone, sharing ski videos with anyone who will watch. She is a skier. She identifies herself wholly as a member of the tribe.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Seeing Kailyn happy on the hill made me happy. I don&rsquo;t regret introducing her to skiing,&rdquo; Mitch says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regret sharing skiing, or biking, or hunting, or fishing or camping ... with Kailyn and Kiara. They will have memories for a lifetime and will make a lifetime of memories more. You support your kids and the things that bring them joy.&rdquo;</p>
			<h5 class="section-headline">A DRIVE TO LEARN</h5>
			<p>The Forsbergs aren&rsquo;t about to relinquish hope that Kailyn will walk. She has surprised them all of her life. She continues to awe them.</p>

			<p>Mitch waited until Kailyn had been at Craig more than a month before finally returning to Eagle to talk with a contractor friend about renovating the family&rsquo;s split-level home to accommodate a wheelchair.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It feels like such a significant next step,&rdquo; he says.</p>
			<p>They celebrate any evidence that buoys a glimmer of hope. Those glimmers arrived early in Kailyn&rsquo;s stay at Craig.</p>
			<p>Kailyn was lying on her belly for one of her first physical therapy sessions. She had been practicing her rolls. It&rsquo;s her favorite move, rolling onto her belly from her back. She throws her arms to her side and pins her chin on her shoulder. It reminds her, she says, of the set-up for a 360 or 540 on skis.</p>
			<p>Adele Stalder, the veteran physical therapist who is directing her rehab, later massages her legs, flexing her feet, ankles and knees. Kailyn&rsquo;s face is buried in a pillow.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you take my shoes off,&rdquo; Kailyn says.</p>
			<p>Everyone around the mat &mdash; the Forsberg posse &mdash; jumps to attention.</p>
			<p>Stalder asks: &ldquo;What am I doing?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Kailyn: &ldquo;You are touching my toes.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Stray messages are navigating through her battered spinal cord. Everyone is ecstatic.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that? She feels something,&rdquo; says grandma Betty Forsberg, who with George has spent every day of the past six weeks with Kailyn. &ldquo;That gives me hope. That right there.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>George and Betty like to say this phrase often. It&rsquo;s become a sort of mantra for the Forsbergs: &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t do that <i>yet</i>.&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="breakout-box-type">The seven men and women at Craig Hospital who are working with California's High Fives Foundation are athletes, not patients.</p>
				<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;They were athletes before they were injured and they remain athletes,&rdquo; says Roy Tuscany, the 33-year-old co-founder and executive director of High Fives, which has helped 79 injured athletes &mdash; mostly skiers and snowboarders &mdash;
					in the past six years with more than $1 million in funding for rehabilitation.</p>
				<p class="breakout-box-type">The foundation is considering a funding request from Kailyn Forsberg, the 15-year-old freeskier who was injured in early April during a national slopestyle competition at Copper Mountain.</p>
				<p class="breakout-box-type">Tuscany, and High Fives&rsquo; first-ever athlete Steve Wallace, met Forsberg last week at Craig Hospital and they shared their message: it gets better.</p>

					<h5 class="breakout-box-headline">TEACHING SMART DECISION-MAKING IN THE MOUNTAINS</h5>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">The two men would know. Tuscany spent a year in a wheelchair after he overshot a jump in the Mammoth Mountain terrain park in 2006, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Wallace suffered a spinal injury in a fall at Squaw Valley in 2008. Through intense rehabilitation, the two are out of their wheelchairs and driven to help athletes who have suffered devastating injuries. Their foundation this year expanded beyond helping just skiers and snowboarders, growing their reach into all mountain sports. The foundation's grant-based athlete recovery fund supports mountain athletes with rehabilitation after insurance runs out.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">The foundation&rsquo;s education program &mdash; designed to promote safety and smart decision-making in the mountains &mdash; has reached more than 100,000 young athletes in the last few years through school presentations, videos and safety awareness campaigns such as &ldquo;Helmets Are Cool.&rdquo;</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;It&lsquo;s pretty amazing to be able to give back,&rdquo; Wallace says.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">The pair spent a few days recently spinning through the rooms of friends at Craig. It was a light-hearted tour, with lots of laughing and hanging out.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really show a weak side,&rdquo; Tuscany says.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">His positive outlook is infectious in a place where the injured are grappling with new life trajectories.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident and comfortable with my awareness that being paralyzed was the best thing that ever happened to me,&rdquo; Tuscany says.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">That&rsquo;s a hard message to sell to someone like Forsberg who is in the first stages of coming to grips with her new life. It&rsquo;s not likely Forsberg is ready to embrace the idea that good can come from her paralysis.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s on her way there. The athletes that succeed are the ones who are comfortable with that realization,&rdquo; Tuscany says.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">Forsberg is telling the High Fives guys about her favorite concerts at Vail Village near her home. She&rsquo;s a big fan of crowd surfing. Even though the sea of hands failed her at a Girl Talk concert and she crashed onto the bricks.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;What if my injury was from crowd surfing and someone dropped me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That would be so embarrassing.&rdquo;</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;But you'd have such a good story,&rdquo; Wallace says.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">It&rsquo;s a good sign that Forsberg is laughing about her injury, Tuscany says later. It&rsquo;s a step toward embracing her new reality.</p>
					<p class="breakout-box-type">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see her joking. I&rsquo;m just blown away by how good she is doing here,&rdquo; Tuscany says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reason Craig is the best. They do amazing work here.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>They have good reason to emphasize the <i>yet</i>. Kailyn has improved by leaps since she arrived. She received a manual wheelchair exactly one month after her accident. Within an hour, she was mastering the wheelie.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Thirty seconds,&rdquo; she says with not a little pride, noting how long she could balance on two wheels. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s harder than a rail slide, that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>She&rsquo;s determined to regain control of her body.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a great drive to learn things,&rdquo; Stalder says. &ldquo;She is focused. She is going to be one of the people on the high end of her level of injury in terms of what she can accomplish.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>For now, Kailyn is thinking about seeing her friends after she checks out of Craig on July 9. Enjoying a bit of the summer when she returns to her home in Eagle sometime in July. She is ready to go fishing.</p>
			<p>She plans to share a message when she gets home: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take anything for granted.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You realize how much you take for granted,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Walking, that&rsquo;s pretty helpful. Legs, they are pretty nice to have. When you don&rsquo;t have them, you are like 'Oh, that&rsquo;s a lot different.' So don&rsquo;t take
				anything for granted. Appreciate it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Despite the painful bite it&rsquo;s inflicted on her, Kailyn isn&rsquo;t giving up on skiing. The rewards of a day on the hill still resonate with her.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I plan to ski again. Mono-skiing seems so hard. I don&rsquo;t know about backflips though,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That would be terrifying. So scary. I&rsquo;m not going to do that. Well, maybe not.&rdquo;</p>

			<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he therapists always ask the same thing after a session at Craig Hospital: &ldquo;Can you move your foot for me?&rdquo; Kailyn Forsberg was ready to dismiss the twice-daily request a couple of weeks ago when a signal from her brain suddenly found a pathway through her damaged spinal cord. Her therapists and her gathered family exploded with excitement, telling her that she moved her toe.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;You guys are on drugs,&rsquo; &ldquo; Kailyn said. &ldquo;Then I looked down and it moved. It was pretty cool. I was so stoked.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Two months and four days after she was paralyzed in a crash at Copper Mountain&rsquo;s terrain park, 15-year-old Kailyn&rsquo;s wiggling toe delivered a glimmer of hope. Maybe that fidgety digit is the first sign of life beyond a wheelchair?</p>
			<p>The voluntary flexing of her toe did more than buoy the spirits of Kailyn and her family. It changed the classification of her spinal injury, which opens doors for more intensive training and high-tech rehabilitation tools. Doctors initially considered Kailyn&rsquo;s spinal injury complete, meaning she had no feeling or movement below the C-7 vertebra that exploded after the semi-pro freeskier over- rotated a backflip during practice for a national slopestyle competition on April 7.</p>
			<p>When she left Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado after a couple of weeks, she had some feeling but no movement below the injury. That sensation in her lower back improved her spinal injury classification to an incomplete Category B. With the movement of her toe, she now is Category C, with both feeling and movement.</p>

				</blockquote>
			</div>

			<p>That&rsquo;s a huge change. Her prognosis is brighter. While Kailyn&rsquo;s feisty spirit and unflappable willpower are fueling her rehabilitation and recovery, that&rsquo;s not enough to make nerves in her spine recover. She can&rsquo;t will herself to walk. But voluntarily movement below the injury in the early stages of recovery is a good sign that more improvements are on the way, especially for younger patients, said Dr. Mark Johansen, Craig&rsquo;s spinal doctor.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are excited about her change. She is in the early stage of her recovery curve ... and she has had a significant change,&rdquo; Johansen said. &ldquo;We are telling her now that we want her to get greedy.&rdquo;</p>
			<h5 class="section-headline">HIGHLIGHT OF HER STAY</h5>
			<p>In her first six weeks at Craig, Kailyn has adapted well, exceeding expectations as she tackles her new life with the same determination she applied to her skiing. She has moved from a hospital bed to a regular bed. She can shower and dress herself. She can perch vertically in the passive standing machine for 20 minutes. Her therapists think she is engaging her abdomen below her injury. (Kailyn isn&rsquo;t so sure about that.) Her right hand is fully strengthened after weeks of training. She balances her wheelchair on two wheels and spins 360s. She is ready to take her driver&rsquo;s test. She can race her wheelchair through Craig&rsquo;s &ldquo;terrain park,&rdquo; a winding collection of gravel, cobblestone, dirt pathways, narrow doorways, sloping curbs and irregular stairs.</p>
			<p>But the highlight of her stay so far, she said, was a visit from Olympic slopestyle skier Bobby Brown. Kailyn, who barely slept the night before Brown&rsquo;s visit, cooked steaks and potatoes for lunch &mdash; an &ldquo;American lunch,&rdquo; she said &mdash; on an outdoor grill, using tongs with her right hand as part of an occupational therapy session.</p>
			<p>She rapped with Brown in the tribal lingo of skiers, talking about sponsors, terrain parks and favorite tricks, using words such as &ldquo;stoked,&rdquo; &ldquo;steez&rdquo; and even &ldquo;dank.&rdquo; Kailyn&rsquo;s mother, Kimberly, jumped in every so often, asking for a definition of a word and noting how her daughter was returning to her precrash cadence and accent, like she was talking shop with pals at the bottom of a ski run.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I definitely hear the skier talk,&rdquo; said Brown, wearing his Red Bull beanie and showing off a fresh tattoo to the awestruck Kailyn. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a skier for sure. I just hear it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Brown spent a couple of hours with Kailyn, hanging out like they were longtime friends. Kailyn let her guard down and was giddy, asking the skiing superstar about the X Games and his snowy travels.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;He sent me a text thanking me for lunch,&rdquo; she said days later. &ldquo;Thanking <em>me</em>.&rdquo;</p>

			<h5 class="section-headline">EVERYONE SHOWS SUPPORT</h5>
			<p>Two months to the day after Kailyn&rsquo;s accident, her dad Mitch strolled through Vail Village. It was the first time he had spent much time in his home valley since his life veered off track. The GoPro Mountain Games were underway. The village was packed. And it seemed that nearly every person knew Mitch, a local school principal. He would take a few steps and hug a friend. A line would form. He thanked everyone he embraced.</p>
			<p>Mitch does a lot of that. Saying thanks. Especially when he is at his house, where a parade of workers are coming and going every day.</p>
			<p>Parents, neighbors and Kailyn&rsquo;s friends spend long nights prepping the split-level home&rsquo;s former ground-floor family room into an apartment &mdash; really a 15-year-old girl&rsquo;s man cave &mdash; for Kailyn. They ripped out flooring and hauled sand to bury the radiant heat before donated flooring is installed. Workers plowed an 8-foot-deep trench in the front yard to build a 28-foot wheelchair ramp into the room, where a window has become a front door.</p>
			<p>With medical bills arriving, Mitch is worried about renovation costs. He needs to find a vehicle that can fit a wheelchair. <a title="Caring for Kailyn fundraiser" href="http://www.youcaring.com/medical-fundraiser/care-for-kailyn-forsberg-/335528">A fundraiser has brought in more than $80,000</a>, but that&rsquo;s just a start for a kid whose life might be spent in a chair.</p>
			<p>He is having a sense of deja vu. When his daughter was freshly injured, no one really told her parents what to expect long term. Doctors probably knew what was ahead, but they asked the overwhelmed parents to focus on the moment. Take it hour by hour, then day to day. He is getting the same feeling from his insurance company and the workers in his house, who are telling him to stop worrying about the cost.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It just makes me nervous. You know how you can really get me to worry? Say &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry.&rsquo; I mean, just accepting all this help is difficult,&rdquo; he said while taking a break from hauling sand and working as a helper to the busy team on the ground floor of his home.</p>
			<p>The renovation started when Mitch asked his former neighbor, Michael Roe, a busy contractor whose 17-year-old son grew up racing around the neighborhood with Kailyn, for help building a wheelchair ramp in the garage.</p>
			<p>Roe first thought about donating cash to Kailyn&rsquo;s medical fund. But he knew he could do better. Most subcontractors Roe employs have kids who attended school in Eagle County, where Mitch started teaching in 1995. Many of them have children at Gypsum Elementary, where Mitch has been the principal since 2004. A lumber yard pitched in materials. Every supplier has donated to the renovation. The town of Eagle building department fast-tracked the renovation.</p>

				</p>
			</div>

			<p>&ldquo;Not a single vendor or subcontractor has balked. When I approached people, everyone &mdash; every single one &mdash; said they would do whatever Mitch needs because he has done so much for everyone&rsquo;s kids,&rdquo; said Roe, who hasn&rsquo;t tallied any charges for Mitch yet. &ldquo;I know Mitch is sweating money. He&rsquo;s always asking, &lsquo;What do you think this will cost?&rsquo; I&rsquo;m telling him the truth when I say I really don&rsquo;t think this is going to cost you anything. Everyone is showing their support for Mitch and Kailyn. They all want to do something because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
			<h5 class="section-headline">&ldquo;TIRED OF ALL THE STUFF&rdquo;</h5>
			<p>This week, if Kailyn can continue to stand vertically in Craig&rsquo;s fourth-floor gym without wild fluctuations in her blood pressure, she will get a spin on the Lokomat machine, a high-tech treadmill that uses robotics to move a patient&rsquo;s legs in a walking gait. Only patients with movement and feeling below their injury get access to the Lokomat, one of the most technologically advanced tools in the Craig arsenal.</p>
			<p>The machine will load Kailyn&rsquo;s legs and move them in a walking pattern while she is suspended upright.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The research shows that doing that for someone with an incomplete injury like hers ... could stimulate the nervous system with hopes of facilitating recovery,&rdquo; said Laura Wehrli, physical therapy supervisor for spinal cord injury patients at Craig.</p>
			<p>Kailyn&rsquo;s emotional recovery is coming along too. Kailyn spent her first month at Craig in amazingly high spirits. She bragged that she hadn&rsquo;t cried since the accident, essentially saying it is what it is. That&rsquo;s no longer true. She has bad days now. She is coming to grips with her arm-draining life in a wheelchair and how much her former world as an extraordinary athlete has changed. It&rsquo;s a grieving process that every Craig patient goes through at some point, say Craig&rsquo;s therapists. Kailyn is still tiptoeing around the darkest part of that process, but she&rsquo;s not ignoring it either.</p>
			<p>There have been blow-ups with therapists. Tearful afternoons. Moments of overwhelming frustration she doesn&rsquo;t want to share.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I just get tired. Tired of all the stuff. All the therapy. And I get grouchy. Then I get angry,&rdquo; she said, deflecting, dodging and answering as briefly as possible when prodded to explain a bad day. &rdquo;I&rsquo;m 15. I&rsquo;m a teenager. I get lazy and I don&rsquo;t want to do anything. I want to just go home and take a nap.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>But she always bounces back. She laughs a lot. She works hard, driven to not just finish what is asked but perfect tasks such as climbing from the floor onto a bed or beating her personal best time rolling through an uphill loop around the hospital.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Finish strong,&rdquo; Mitch yells as his daughter heaves into her wheels, her chin touching her knees as she grinds up a ramp toward the finish line.</p>
			<p>She finishes the loop in 6 minutes, 18 seconds. Three minutes faster than last time.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I need a break. Can I have a break?&rdquo;</p>

      <p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>ears are streaming down the tiny lady&rsquo;s face. She keeps saying &ldquo;<i>gracias, gracias</i>&rdquo; as she embraces Kailyn Forsberg. Kailyn returns the hug and pushes her wheelchair away without looking back. Everyone around is tearing up. But Kailyn just rolls, stone-faced, out the door.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Why was that lady crying?&rdquo; someone asks.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Kailyn says. &ldquo;I guess I hugged her once.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>A few weeks ago Kailyn was deep into her three-month stay at Craig Hospital, learning how to adapt to life in a wheelchair. She  passed that lady in the hallway. The lady was sobbing. Kailyn, a stoic 15-year-old with a broken neck, wheeled her chair around and asked the lady if she needed a hug. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;She just looked like she needed it,&rdquo; Kailyn says. </p>
      <p> Thursday, Kailyn was doling out more high-fives and  hugs. She was done with Craig, heading home to Eagle and a new life. The last time she slept in her own bed, she was a tenacious freeskier, harvesting medals and planning a career on skis. She is returning the same aloof teenager, only seated. </p>

			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen a single person in Eagle in a wheelchair,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make being in a wheelchair the cool thing. I&rsquo;ll make it the next big thing.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s been an arduous three months as Kailyn &mdash;  along with her mom Kimberly, dad Mitch and sister Kiara &mdash;  negotiated a path no one plans to travel. She rolled into world-renowned Craig Hospital without any movement below her midchest. She had exploded her C-7 vertebra in early April when she over-rotated a backflip in the USA Snowboard and Freeski Association&rsquo;s slopestyle national championship  at Copper Mountain&rsquo;s terrain park. She is leaving with a host of wheelchair skills and strengths. And she is able to wiggle her left toe, a slight movement that hopefully portends walking at some point.</p>
      <p>But the wiggling digit is not her greatest achievement at the rehabilitation center. She will tell you her best  moment at Craig is leaving. (She can be surly.) But really, Kailyn&rsquo;s successes have more to do with that lady in the hallway. </p>
      <p>She might not acknowledge it, but Kailyn&rsquo;s relentless determination to live a normal life &mdash;  seated or not &mdash;  has sent ripples of inspiration beyond the halls of Craig. </p>
      <p>That&rsquo;s evident in the volunteer work crew that has swarmed her Eagle home in the last two months &mdash;  converting a lower level into a wheelchair-friendly apartment she is calling &ldquo;Kailyn&rsquo;s Crib.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s seen in the hundreds of followers who check  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/caringforkailyn" title="Caring for Kailyn">her Facebook page</a>, leaving grateful notes to the feisty teen whose resolve puts most everyday problems in perspective. And it&rsquo;s seen in those hugs, which are almost enough to prod a few tears out of Kailyn. </p>
      <p>At a goodbye pizza party the night before her departure, she would stare at a wall and take deep inhales to stave off her welling emotions. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been caught off guard a couple times lately and it&rsquo;s like, &rsquo;What is this I&rsquo;m feeling?&rsquo; &rdquo; Kimberly says. &ldquo;I tell her, &rsquo;Those are emotions, Kailyn. Get used to them.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
      <h5 class="section-headline">PERFECT PRACTICE PREFERRED</h5>
      <p>That moving toe qualified Kailyn for sessions on the Lokomat machine, a robotic gizmo that moves listless legs in a heel-striking gait on a treadmill. It&rsquo;s one of Craig&rsquo;s most technologically advanced tools, available only to patients who have both mobility and sensation below their injury. After several weeks of sessions in the standing frame and pedaling the Functional Electronic Stimulation bike, Kailyn graduated to the Lokomat a few weeks before her July 9 Craig graduation.</p>
      <p>Kailyn, amped on blue Red Bull, flops onto a foam wedge where a team of therapists strap her into a hanging harness. Soon she  is suspended over a treadmill and robotic arms are clamped to her legs. </p>
      <p>She calls the hanging contraption &ldquo;the ultimate wedgie.&rdquo;</p>

				</p>
			</div>

      <p>A graph on a computer screen shows the machine is holding about 51 percent of her body weight. The next week it will hold only 46 percent of her weight. Another graph shows lines reflecting the amount of activity in her left and right knees and hips. A blip in those lines means Kailyn is controlling some of her walking movement. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;Our goal with this is to truly get those reps &mdash;  those hundreds, thousands of steps &mdash;  to flood the body with sensory input,&rdquo; says physical therapist Audrey Natale. &ldquo;Perfect practice makes perfect. The evidence shows you can get motor output with that.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>When she is on her feet, everyone marvels at Kailyn&rsquo;s height. Mitch and Kimberly have forgotten how tall she is. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;I swear she&rsquo;s grown an inch or more in the last few months,&rdquo; Mitch says, staring at his upright daughter, a too-rare scene he no longer takes for granted.</p>
      <p>Kailyn isn&rsquo;t paying attention to the computer screen graphs. She is on her phone, watching a ski video. She hands her phone to a visitor. A skier lands a spinning, complex trick. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;What is that? How is that possible?&rdquo; she says.</p>
      <p>The lines on the graph are largely flat during most sessions. But in late June, her left knee and hip are showing signs of life. It may be just a reflex in her hip flexor, Natale warns. </p>
      <p>Or it may be her leg answering her order to move.  </p>
      <p>That gets Kailyn&rsquo;s attention. The animated man on the screen keeps veering sharply to the right. It might be that hip flexor. It might be that she is getting messages to her left leg. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;Step with the right, Kailyn,&rdquo; Mitch says. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be terrible if we get you walking again and you can only walk in circles?"</p>
      <h5 class="section-headline">RELEARNING EVERYTHING</h5>
      <p>Kailyn won&rsquo;t admit to any nervousness about her return home. Ask her about it and she uses one of her favorite words: &ldquo;Stoked.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Mitch suspects otherwise, but he&rsquo;s not pushing. Prodding for contemplation or reflection gets nowhere with Kailyn. He knows because she is a lot like him. Both of them use humor and deflection as  go-to coping skills. It works for them. Things get heavy and they become a lighthearted comedy duo, finishing each other&rsquo;s sentences and batting around inside jokes.</p>
      <p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean there haven&rsquo;t been moments of frustration. For weeks, Kailyn hated the standing frame, a ratcheting machine that pushes seated patients into a vertical position, fully weighted on their feet. She avoided it. Bailed after a couple minutes. </p>
      <p>That didn&rsquo;t surprise Avery LeFleur, her clinical care manager. </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy. It looks like it shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard and it&rsquo;s tough when you have a hard time with it,&rdquo; LeFleur says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my athletic individuals that have the most difficulty with the more athletic things because it used to be easy for them. These things used to come naturally for them and now it&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s a lot like starting over again as a baby. You have to relearn everything.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Mitch didn&rsquo;t push too hard about the standing frame and eventually Kailyn came around. Now she happily hangs for 20 minutes or more, relishing the change of view.   She has  a standing frame waiting for her at home in Eagle. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;She really had anxiety regarding that standing and she really conquered that,&rdquo; says Adele Stalder, the physical therapist in charge of Kailyn&rsquo;s rehab. </p>
      <p>Stalder says Kailyn&rsquo;s ability to transfer from the floor to her wheelchair &mdash; a rarity for someone with such a high spinal injury &mdash;  marks another of her greatest achievements at Craig. Moving forward,  Stalder expects Kailyn will see that anxiety creep back when she tries her firsts. First time on an airplane. First camping trip. First day back at school.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Those will be hard for her. I think she has always mastered things really easily. She wants to succeed and there&rsquo;s a little bit of anxiousness whenever she does something new,&rdquo; Stalder says. </p>
      <p>Stalder and Mitch  use the same phrase when it comes to how they motivate the sometimes surly, hard-shelled Kailyn. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;Pick your battles,&rdquo; they say. </p>
      <p>Mitch knows that well. He is very familiar with what it takes to motivate his oldest daughter. A few weeks ago she was dragging on paperwork to qualify as a High Fives Foundation athlete, which means she can get support with the California group that funds rehabilitative therapy for outdoor athletes. She needs to give High Fives a list of five goals, so the group can gauge her progress in a year. She hasn&rsquo;t moved beyond &ldquo;leave Craig.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t want to add more. Mitch kept pushing, saying he would fill it out if she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
      <p>Eventually she added to the list: go skiing again, go bird hunting, get her driver&rsquo;s license and get a service dog. </p>
      <p>The list worked for Mitch and Kimberly. But it didn&rsquo;t include &ldquo;walk.&rdquo; That pains them. They came into Craig with a singular goal: walk out. Mitch remembers when they first arrived at Craig and the head doctor put his arm around Mitch and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll fix your little girl.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>&ldquo;What I heard in that is &rsquo;Let&rsquo;s get her back,&rsquo; &ldquo; Mitch says. </p>
      <p>But what happens at Craig isn&rsquo;t always a return to normal. Craig&rsquo;s rehabilitative focus is often about instilling the tools needed to work with what you have: a wheelchair. Sometimes those tools get people walking. More often, they prepare paralyzed patients for things such as transferring from a chair into a shower or a car or an airplane seat. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;They said when she moved her toe we needed to get greedy. We got greedy. We are greedy,&rdquo; Mitch says. &ldquo;But what I&rsquo;m learning is that just wanting it more doesn&rsquo;t mean you get it. That left toe twitch might be all she gets. We aren&rsquo;t settling for that, though. We never will.&rdquo;</p>

			<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he little girl, about 8 or 9, sheepishly hands Kailyn Forsberg a swollen envelope. Inside is $121.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It was from her lemonade stand this summer. I used to babysit her,&rdquo; Kailyn says later. &ldquo;It was cool.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>As the moon and sun trade horizons over Eagle&rsquo;s Brush Creek Pavilion on a cool summer  night, more than 800 Eagle County residents are rallying around one of their own. Kailyn, her wheelchair bogging in the lush grass, stays tucked into a corner of the park. She&rsquo;s wearing her trademark tie-dye. A horde of girls guard her perimeter. The 15-year-old isn&rsquo;t keen on all the attention. Soon, she rolls out of sight. </p>
			<p>The fundraiser set records for the 19-year-old Vail Valley Charitable Fund, which organized the &ldquo;Caring for Kailyn&rdquo; event. Kailyn was surprised at the showing. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;I was thinking there would just be a few people,&rdquo; she says. </p>
			<p>It was early April when Forsberg spun hard off the lip of the jump in Copper Mountain&rsquo;s terrain park.  A day after winning a silver medal in the halfpipe at the USA Snowboard and Freeski Association&rsquo;s national competition, the aspiring freeskier was warming up for the day&rsquo;s slopestyle contest. She was practicing her signature huck, a backflip. She over-rotated and landed on the back of her head. She has been in a hospital bed or a wheelchair since, paralyzed from the chest down. </p>
			<p>After two months of intensive rehabilitation at Englewood&rsquo;s renowned Craig Hospital, Forsberg returned home to Eagle in July. It&rsquo;s been a transition on par with the difficulty of her daily physical transitions from chair to car, or bed to chair, or chair to shower. </p>
			<p>She has her dark days. And the somber moments can be exceptionally gloomy. She is missing a lot of school because of  illness and issues surrounding her injury. She is falling behind in her classwork, and those missed days erode her social support &mdash; so important to 15-year-olds. She can fall into a funk, overwhelmed when, as her dad, Mitch, says, &ldquo;the permanence of things washes over her.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>Nothing is easy, but her friends are smoothing her passage into the new normal.  </p>
			<h5 class="section-headline">AS HAPPY AS SHE CAN BE</h5>
			<p>After about an hour at the fundraiser, Kailyn leaves for home, a couple of  blocks away. She plans to return, but soon her newly finished basement apartment is swollen with teenagers. They fall silent as a graying grown-up lumbers in, crashing their party. The music &mdash;  electronic dance stuff &mdash; is thumping. A rotation of girls sits on Kailyn&rsquo;s lap. They play with each other&rsquo;s hair and mumble. Someone makes pancakes, sprinkling bacon bits in the batter. The Tiki torches on her new patio, anchored by a winding wheelchair ramp, are flickering. </p>
			<p>Kailyn looks about as happy as she can be. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to hang out with my friends,&rdquo; she says, explaining her departure from the party. &ldquo;Plus, it was old-person music.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Back at the fundraiser, Mitch and Kailyn&rsquo;s mother, Kimberly, are busy. Lines of well-wishers wind around them. Everyone wants to share a moment. There are plenty of awkward embraces, handshakes and glances that reflect a muddled mix of love, sorrow and appreciation. </p>
			<p>Mitch, the longtime principal at Gypsum Elementary, greets kids he taught in the 1990s. Some have brought their own children. There are kids everywhere. His custodian is there, one of several dozen red-shirted volunteers. His teachers are manning the beer taps. Even more are helping to distribute donated food from local restaurants such as Pazzo&rsquo;s and Moe&rsquo;s Original BBQ. The bid sheets for 175 silent auction items are filled. A poster labeled &ldquo;Kailyn&rsquo;s Wish List&rdquo; shows therapeutic needs such as a standing frame and an electronic muscle stimulation bike as well as adaptive toys such as a hand-pedaled bike and a sit ski.</p>
			<p>Mitch never gets an opportunity to eat. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;So many people we&rsquo;ve never even met,&rdquo; he says the next day. &ldquo;But everyone knows Kailyn by name. This community has got her back.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The $25-a-person event raised a lot of money. Vail Valley Charitable Fund president Michelle Maloney says the fundraiser was &ldquo;by far&rdquo; the biggest since she joined the fund three years ago, although figures weren&rsquo;t announced. Maloney says the donations are continuing to come in.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Everyone is very in tune with the fact that the Forsbergs are in a tough spot,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Kailyn knew how much support she had in the community. That was our community at its finest.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The next day, Mitch, his family and a few friends are helping set up Kailyn&rsquo;s ground-floor apartment. Local contractor Michael Roe &mdash;  a longtime family friend whose son grew up playing with Kailyn &mdash;  has directed a team of workers in transforming the lower level into &ldquo;Kailyn&rsquo;s Crib.&rdquo; </p>

			<!-- BLOCKQUOTE -->

				<blockquote>&ldquo;Home has to be no challenge, because the rest of the world is a challenge.&rdquo;

				</blockquote>
			</div>

			<p>Everything is reachable from a chair. The shower is wheelchair-friendly. So are the new wood floors, which Kailyn calls her  &ldquo;Gucci floor.&rdquo; A photo from Craig Hospital of her and freeskiing hero Bobby Brown hangs over the sink. Her grandparents bought her a new flat-screen television. She&rsquo;s eager to hook it up and start playing Skyrim and Fallout. </p>
			<p>Everything is within a reach or a roll. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Home has to be no challenge, because the rest of the world is a challenge,&rdquo; says Kailyn&rsquo;s grandmother, Betty Forsberg, visiting from Michigan. </p>
			<p>There&rsquo;s a corner reserved for her FES bike. The $21,000 functional electrical stimulation machine &mdash;  which is on order &mdash;  uses electrical current to stimulate nerves and muscles. </p>
			<p>At school, where she is a sophomore at Eagle Valley High, a  group of friends rolls with her between classes, easing her into the flow. She is  taking a college-level class in environmental science, helping to install and monitor wildlife cameras at the nearby Gypsum Ponds State Wildlife Area. She is pondering an after-school gig supervising kids at her dad&rsquo;s school.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;d pick me for that. You know me. Safety is a priority,&rdquo; she says, cracking wise, as is her way.</p>
			<p>She doesn&rsquo;t say much about school. She never really liked school.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;School is gross. But good,&rdquo; she says.</p>
			<h5 class="section-headline">IT&rsquo;S ALL ABOUT PERSPECTIVE</h5>
			<p>On the home front, Mitch talks about how the flow of construction workers in the past  four months has helped shift his thinking a little bit. He was the guy who was reticent to nail into sheetrock.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to put a hole in the wall. Don&rsquo;t be daunted by making mistakes,&rdquo; he says.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s all about a shift in perspective, he says.</p>
			<p>Kailyn is snapping portraits amid a gaggle of neighbor kids in the street when Mitch tells a story about a new third-grader at his school. </p>
			<p>A few weeks ago, the precocious little girl approached Mitch with a question. It was about Kailyn. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Did she die or something?&rdquo; the little girl asked. </p>
			<p>No, Mitch answered. He explained the spinal cord injury.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mitch remembers the little girl saying, pausing for dramatic effect.</p>
			<p>This is where the always-listening Kailyn jumps in, hollering from the street:</p>
			<p>&ldquo;At least she&rsquo;s not dead, right?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;At least she&rsquo;s not dead,&rdquo; Mitch says. &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s just perspective. Kailyn fell from 40 feet in the air onto her neck and her life is changed. But she&rsquo;s still the same kid I always loved.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Mitch so loved watching Kailyn ski. He supported her freeskiing,  traveling across the country for contests with his girl. He always joked &ldquo;go fast, take chances&rdquo; when she headed out onto the terrain park. But he never pushed her. She did enough pushing on her own. She was daring, but not a daredevil. </p>
			<p>Despite her occasional disheartening days, Kailyn has avoided a prolonged despondency. Her highs might not eclipse her lows, but she has encouraging moments. </p>
			<p>Mitch  marvels that she hasn&rsquo;t lashed out at him or turned against skiing. (She still watches ski videos all the time.) But when he makes that comment, he adds the word &ldquo;yet.&rdquo; He fears a day where she blames him. If it ever comes.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;These are the things I think about at 3 a.m. when I can&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; he says. </p>

			<p>The back of Kailyn Forsberg&rsquo;s checkered hoodie reads: &ldquo;The Struggle Is Real.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>And constant.</p>
			<p>Nothing has been easy for the 15-year-old since April 7, when she landed on her neck after backflipping in Copper Mountain&rsquo;s terrain park. </p>
			<p>That was the day she last skied. The last day she walked. The last day she moved her legs.</p>
			<p>She battled through three months of intense rehab at the renowned Craig Hospital in Englewood. Back home in Eagle, she&rsquo;s still fighting as she transitions into a new life on wheels. She keeps hope alive that she will someday walk again. Mostly she cradles that hope at night, as she wiggles her left big toe. On a good night, she will spend hours moving that toe. Sometimes all her toes light up in pain. She says it&rsquo;s like when her feet would defrost after a cold day on the hill. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;You act like it doesn&rsquo;t hurt, but that&rsquo;s impossible. Sure, the doctors say that pain is good, but it&rsquo;s still pain,&rdquo; she says, noting how the fiery tingle means nerves are firing, finding new pathways to navigate her mangled spinal cord. &ldquo;I definitely have hope. At Craig, there were so many people, they didn&rsquo;t have anything when they got there, but then they started to get stuff back after, like, two years.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Some days are good: deer hunting in Utah, learning to drive her dad&rsquo;s truck and, the best yet, spinning an Arctic Cat UTV through new snow up Hardscrabble Mountain near her home. </p>
			<p>More days are bad: alone in her house, too ill to attend school, watching daytime TV and burying dark emotions as the future weighs heavy.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, it&rsquo;s like &lsquo;OK, this really sucks,&rsquo; &rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same low point as usual. No stopping it, really.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>The gloom reached an apex in September. She was skipping a lot of school, dealing with medical issues related to her paralysis. She was lobbying for home schooling while her dad, the principal at Gypsum Elementary, pushed her to get back to her teenage life at Eagle Valley High.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;She needs that social setting,&rdquo; says Mitch Forsberg. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be inside all day long.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>Then her close pal, Sam Jackenthal, died Oct. 1, succumbing to a head injury after a skiing accident at Australia&rsquo;s Perisher ski area. Sam was a top-ranked freeskier, just like Kailyn. Both were up-and-coming juniors, harvesting medals in halfpipe and slopestyle contests.</p>
			<p>The day before Kailyn&rsquo;s accident, Sam was cheering as she stuck a 270-degree spin on the downtube to win a silver medal in the rail contest at the USA Snowboard and Freeski Association&rsquo;s national championships at Copper.  A photo of that monster trick hangs in Kailyn&rsquo;s room.</p>
			<p>Mitch still keeps a video of his girl&rsquo;s silver-medal performance on his phone. &ldquo;Just watching Kailyn trying to stay on his heels through the night skiing zone was pretty awesome.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Kailyn went to  Sam&rsquo;s memorial service in Park City, Utah, last month. It was her first big trip since the crash. She was sad but torn by the realization that she could have easily suffered a similar fate.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;He was just having fun. It&rsquo;s a risk of skiing, I guess,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s weird, but, at the funeral, it made me feel kind of lucky.&rdquo;</p>
			<h5 class="section-headline">LOVING A CHANCE TO HELP</h5>
			<p>Kailyn helps out three days a week at an after-school program at her dad&rsquo;s school. Last week, the kids were building vehicles out of Lego-like kits.</p>
			<p>A little girl comes up and asks Kailyn for help with a piece of plastic. Kailyn likes to say she&rsquo;s not a fan of kids &mdash; &ldquo;They are so loud all the time&rdquo; &mdash; but  seems to relish a chance to help.</p>
			<p>Teacher Lauren Mill approaches Kailyn afterward. It&rsquo;s time for a talk.</p>
			<p>Kailyn often shows up late. Some days she doesn&rsquo;t show up at all. The teachers who run the after-school program want to sit down and set guidelines for the job. They want her to take this work more seriously.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m over it,&rdquo; says Mill, giving Mitch a glance.</p>

				<blockquote>&ldquo;I think it is pretty awesome that she can open up about what happened and answer questions from students without a filter. She seems to me to be a very good role model. The kids look up to her.&rdquo;

			<p>He smiles. He&rsquo;s glad to have someone else pushing his daughter, holding her accountable. The wheelchair can&rsquo;t always be an excuse.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are going to sit down and go over our expectations,&rdquo; Mill says later. &ldquo;Maybe she just needs a little more guidance.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Mill sometimes senses that Kailyn is coasting, on a sort of post-accident honeymoon, where she can roll without trying too hard.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t she cruise if she knows she can get away with it?&rdquo; Mill wonders.</p>
			<p>Sometimes the little kids come up and ask Kailyn about her injury. She tells them exactly what happened and that she can&rsquo;t walk. She talks to the elementary school students the same as she does adults or friends. There&rsquo;s no sugar coating.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think it is pretty awesome that she can open up about what happened and answer questions from students without a filter,&rdquo; says Brittany Rivera, the Gypsum Elementary teacher who runs the after-school program. &ldquo;She seems to me to be a very good role model. The kids look up to her.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>There&rsquo;s no question that 10-year-old Kiara looks up to her big sister. Kiara can&rsquo;t really talk to Kailyn without touching her. A couple of fingers on her knee. A hand under her leg. Stroking her hair.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s really warm,&rdquo; says Kiara, explaining the constant contact.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s more than warmth, though. Kiara works every night to find an excuse to sleep downstairs in bed with her sister. She doesn&rsquo;t like sleeping in her room upstairs, even though Mitch repainted and added some new furniture &mdash; a way to keep pace with the completely renovated, wheelchair-friendly downstairs, which is known as Kailyn&rsquo;s Crib.</p>
			<p>The sisters are very close. Kailyn teases her, calling Kiara &ldquo;my little slave.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Kiara has developed a servant&rsquo;s heart when it comes to her big sister. She jumps every time Kailyn needs help. Which is often.</p>
			<p>Kailyn was in her bathroom one night last week when she hollered for Kiara to help. Kiara, forgetting her new role, quickly answered that she was busy eating. But as soon as the words left her mouth, she snapped back to her reality as vital assistant.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Oh, hold on a second,&rdquo; she says, leaping up from the table.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I like to help her. She needs me,&rdquo; Kiara says a few minutes later.</p>
			<h5 class="section-headline">AN INDEPENDENT KID</h5>
			<p>Kailyn is an independent kid. She has always been fond of doing things herself. She was never keen on asking for help. That has changed. It had to.</p>
			<p>When a visitor offers to drive her to school, she demurs. She has only climbed into her dad&rsquo;s Tundra, using a strap that hangs from the overhead handle. Mitch offers Kailyn $20 to take the ride, which would keep him from having to leave work to go home and bring her  back to her school. But she never takes a ride with anyone but him.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You know you are so weird about that stuff,&rdquo; Mitch says. &ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;To save you $20,&rdquo; Kailyn says, ducking the question.</p>
			<p>Is it because she doesn&rsquo;t like asking for help?</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it was really me being independent or that I&rsquo;m just scared of people. It&rsquo;s scary to just go up and talk to people. So, yeah, it&rsquo;s hard to ask for help sometimes,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was always like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m fine, don&rsquo;t worry about me.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
			<p>That&rsquo;s a big part of why she likes her crib, which is a sort of sanctuary. It&rsquo;s one of the only places where she can hang without assistance.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really need help in this place,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I like it like that.&rdquo;</p>

			<h5 class="section-headline">LOOK OF ANGST ON HER FACE</h5>
			<p>Kailyn, a sophomore, has worked with Eagle Valley High administrators to arrange half days at school. The early mornings were hard. It takes her a long time to go through her routine, take her meds and get ready. The 12:30 p.m. start is easier, even though that means she will have to attend summer school to stay on track and  graduate in 2018. </p>
			<p>Rolling into the school office last week, Kailyn throws her head back, a look of angst on her face. She forgot the elevator key. She&rsquo;s supposed to drop it off at the office at the end of each day, but she often forgets. Now she has two of the school&rsquo;s lanyard-strapped keys somewhere back at the house. The secretary is not pleased.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is the only one left,&rdquo; she says, handing the key  over the counter.</p>
			<p>Kailyn promises to return it and wheels to the elevator.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It always smells like this,&rdquo; she warns, maneuvering into the small, musty box.</p>
			<p>In math class, she sidles up to a table of girls. She flips her neon orange Under Armour backpack on her lap and uses it as a desk. Mr. Unkert is showing 30 students how to graph quadratic functions. There&rsquo;s a quiz the next day.</p>
			<p>Kailyn leans into her table and asks the fellow students a question about the math problem. They answer in Spanish. They are laughing, so it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anything about quadratic functions or the First-Outer-Inner-Last strategy that Unkert is teaching for solving the complicated math problem.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I never understand anything they are saying. I like them, though. They laugh a lot,&rdquo; Kailyn says later.</p>
			<p>In English, Kailyn writes a short story using the week&rsquo;s vocabulary words. In world history, she learns about Egypt. Later that afternoon, she wonders how much of what she&rsquo;s learning will be useful later in life.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be at a monoski competition and be like, &lsquo;Oh wait, let me graph this quadratic function really quick.&rsquo; Right,&rdquo; she says, twisting her mouth into a smirk that is one of her signature looks.</p>
			<p>That&rsquo;s one of the few times Kailyn has hinted at her goals or aspirations. Asked specifically about her future, she often diverts, talking instead about reaching the next level on a video game or plotlines in her favorite TV shows.</p>
			<p>But she&rsquo;s eager to get back on the hill. Her eyes light up when she talks about winter.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I love the silence of fresh snow,&rdquo; she says.</p>
			<h5 class="section-headline">SWITCHING TO SKI MODE</h5>
			<p>It&rsquo;s easy to suspect that the season&rsquo;s first snowfall would be a downer for Kailyn. For skiers, that first powder coating is a signal to switch to ski mode.</p>
			<p>Despite the chair, Kailyn is making the switch.</p>
			<p>Kailyn has spent most of her life identifying as a skier. She was incredible, floating lofty backflips &mdash; her signature stunt &mdash; and winning medals on her unwavering march toward being a pro freeskier.</p>
			<p> She still thinks of herself as a skier. She&rsquo;s just going to switch rides, moving from her feet to a seat. She&rsquo;s plotting with a few of her Craig Hospital friends about days on the hill. She has heard that the transition is much easier with a good coach. She&rsquo;s ready. Skiing seems to be one of the few things that fires her up. It always has.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so stoked for the snow,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to ski. I&rsquo;m going to be a monoskier.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Alana Nichols was heading to college to play softball when she broke her back after hitting a jump on a snowboard 15 years ago. Since then, she has become  <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/olympics/ci_24678829/" title="Paralympic skier Alana Nichols defending four medals in Sochi Games">one of the world&rsquo;s top Paralympians</a> and the first American female to win gold medals in both the Summer and Winter Olympics.</p>
			<p>Today, she tours the world as a professional athlete, skiing, kayaking and surfing. She urges Kailyn to keep an open mind during those first days in a sit-ski.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;At first, it was kind of disappointing because it wasn&rsquo;t like it was before,&rdquo; Nichols says. &ldquo;But once I came around and saw it as an opportunity, a chance to be outside having fun, it was huge.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Kailyn hasn&rsquo;t really spent much time with athletes like Nichols. She should, Nichols says.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It was a pivotal moment for me when I met other folks in a chair who had been where I was and had evolved into a person who was happy, and they had found freedom in so many other ways,&rdquo; Nichols says. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s a mission of mine. To really show people what&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s still too early for Kailyn to recognize or explore any potential upside to her injury. She&rsquo;s still working through the unavoidable grieving process. She has lost a lot.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;When she&rsquo;s ready, she will see there is so much to do and so much life to live,&rdquo; Nichols said.</p>
			<p>Elana Chase, one of  <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_22454457/vail-ski-club-coach-elana-chase-has-trained" title="Vail Ski club coach Elena Chase has trained 20 X Games skiers">Kailyn&rsquo;s coaches at the Ski &amp; Snowboard Club Vail</a>, has no doubt she will rip in her sit-ski.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What I personally have witnessed over this summer is a very strong-willed young woman,&rdquo; Chase says of Kailyn&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
			<p>The Vail team has offered to help Kailyn buy a customized sit-ski.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We felt it was important to encourage Kailyn to keep on living through the mountains she grew up in and have access to do so through the sport of sit-skiing,&rdquo; Chase says. &ldquo;Kailyn is a sports jock and has that athlete mind-set. That shouldn&rsquo;t have to change.&rdquo;</p>
